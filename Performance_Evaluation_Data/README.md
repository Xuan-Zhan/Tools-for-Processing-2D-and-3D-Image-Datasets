# Experiment Data: 3D and 2D Performance Evaluation

This repository contains the experimental data for the evaluation of performance in both 3D and 2D contexts. 

## 2D Output Image Analysis

During the process of generating 2D output images, certain observations were made:

- Results for **Colour Correction** and **Simple Per-Pixel Modifiers**, as well as **Edge Detection**, were quickly obtained.
- The **Image Blur** processing, on the other hand, required a significantly longer time to produce results.

Given these findings, the 2D portion of our experiments focused specifically on testing the **Blur** aspect.
